This is the conclusion.

\section{Future Work}
One of the criticisms leveed against traditional complexity analysis is there
is no formal connection between the source language program and the recurrence
for its cost. Although the method from \citet{Danner2015} does provide the
formal connection, the translation from source language to complexity language
and subsequent interpretation is tedious and prone to errors. Automation of the
source to complexity translation and interpretation could easily be automated.
Both transformations are simply forms of cross compilation between different
languages. This leaves only the process of obtaining closed form solutions of
recurrences initially obtained from the interpretation. Solving the recurrences
requires a significant amount of cleverness. For simpler recurrences such as
\T{list map}, the recurrences are straightforward to solve. However for more
complex functions, the recurrences may be very difficult to solve. Consider a
function that calculates the $n$th term of the Fibonacci sequence. Under an
interpretation of natural numbers as the number of successor constructors, the
potential of this function is the $n$th Fibonacci number. The closed form
solution to the potential recurrence is
\[
  \frac{(1 + \sqrt{5})^n + (1 - \sqrt{5})^n}{2^n\sqrt{5}}
\]
Obtaining this solution is not at all obvious.
